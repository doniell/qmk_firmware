This keyboard layout is based on the NEO2 concept (see neo-layout.org). Both a QWERTZ and a KOY base layer (see adnw.de) is available. It also features a layer designed for gaming and a layer for the use of Avid Pro Tools.

All layers use a reduced amount of keys, such that the layout is easily adaptable to a preonic or even planck key layout.

The Game Layer is similar to a QWERTY layout and has the arrow keys assigned on the base layer.

The Pro Tools Layer switches the arrangement of GUI/ALT/CTL, such that Pro Tools on Windows has the same keyboard shortcuts as on a Mac. A single alt key press is prevented from activating the menu bar.

The additional MOD5 layer contains the F-Keys and typographic quotation marks.

LEDs indicate the active base layer.
